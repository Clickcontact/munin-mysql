 - Parse transaction section of innodb status.

 - Status from SHOW PROCESSLIST. How useful is this?

 - Document graph interpretation

 - Measure slave lag by using maatkit's mk-heartbeat if present

 - The Cacti 'Query Cache Memory Usage' graph includes
   Qcache_total_blocks and Qcache_free_blocks in addition to
   query_cache_size Qcache_free_memory. Can't see how these fit in
   the same graph since they have different scale (blocks vs
   bytes). Make a separate graph and include Qcache_lowmem_prunes?

 - Add vlabel on graphs. 

 - Add documentation on minimum privileges needed (USAGE or SUPER
   depending on which tables are accessed)

 - Make suggest only list applicable graphs? E.g. Don't suggest
   InnoDB graphs if InnoDB is not used on the system,

 - Only gather the data necesarry for the graphs that are used

 - Cache results in a file if Cache::SharedMemoryCache is not
   installed? Or implement our own shared memory cache?

 - Make autoconf look in the process list for Ã¥ mysql server

 - use InnoDBParser from innotop?

 - What to do with truncated innodb status?

   * http://innotop.sourceforge.net/innotop.html#item_d_3a_innodb_deadlocks
   * http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=19825
   * Use some values from SHOW STATUS

 - SHOW ENGINE INNODB STATUS fails when server is started with
   --skip-innodb and also
