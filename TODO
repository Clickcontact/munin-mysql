 - Parse transaction section of innodb status. This section gets
   truncated when many transactions are running. Doesn't that make it
   valueless for munin-purposes?

 - Status from SHOW PROCESSLIST. How useful is this?

 - Document graph interpretation

 - Measure slave lag by using maatkit's mk-heartbeat if present

 - The Cacti 'Query Cache Memory Usage' graph includes
   Qcache_total_blocks and Qcache_free_blocks in addition to
   query_cache_size Qcache_free_memory. Can't see how these fit in
   the same graph since they have different scale (blocks vs
   bytes). Make a separate graph and include Qcache_lowmem_prunes?

 - Add vlabel on graphs. 

 - Add documentation on minimum privileges needed (USAGE or SUPER
   depending on which tables are accessed)

 - Make suggest only list applicable graphs? E.g. Don't suggest
   InnoDB graphs if InnoDB is not used on the system,

 - Only gather the data necesarry for the graphs that are used

 - Cache results in a file if Cache::SharedMemoryCache is not
   installed? Or implement our own shared memory cache?

 - Make autoconf look in the process list for Ã¥ mysql server

 - use InnoDBParser from innotop?
