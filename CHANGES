2009-03-21: version 0.1.2

 - Improved tests

 - More robust InnoDB status parsing. Handle different order of the
   sections. Handle 64 bit integers written in hexadecimal notation.

 - Added autoconf capability.
  
 - More documentation
  
 - Renamed a graph: mysql_queries -> mysql_commands. This was done so
   that you can have the original mysql graphs side-by-side with the
   ones provided here.
  
 - Easier installation
  
 - Removed the 'check' configuration option -- it didn't really
   work very well.


2009-02-21: version 0.1.1

 - Fixed bug that made parsing of SHOW ENGINE INNODB STATUS enter an
   infinite loop

 - Removed dependency on Math::BigInt::GMP. Caused segfaults.
 
 - Changed drawing type LINE to LINE1 for better compability with
   older versions of munin/rrdtool
